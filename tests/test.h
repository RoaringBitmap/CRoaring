//      void test_function(void **state)
//
// Originally the C tests would declare it like:
//
//      void test_function()
//
// But in C++ that would not match the type, so the C++ tests declared as:
//
//      void test_function(void **)
//
// There's a problem if you're trying to write code that will compile in
// either C or C++, because it's not legal in C99 to not name a parameter...
// and if you give it a name, then there will be complaints that the paramter
// is not used.
//
// Disabling bad cast warnings in C++ defeats the point of compiling in C++,
// and knowing when parameters aren't referenced is useful even in tests.  So
// rather than disabling warnings, this defines a macro to declare the tests.
