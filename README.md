# CRoaring [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring.png)](https://travis-ci.org/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring)
Roaring bitmaps in C (and C++)

# Introduction

Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory.
 To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps.

Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to outperform conventional compressed bitmaps such as WAH, EWAH or Concise.
They are used by several major systems such as [Apache Lucene][lucene] and derivative systems such as [Solr][solr] and
[Elasticsearch][elasticsearch], [Metamarkets' Druid][druid], [LinkedIn Pinot][pinot], [Netflix Atlas][atlas],  [Apache Spark][spark], [Whoosh][whoosh] and eBay's [Apache Kylin][kylin].

Roaring bitmaps are found to work well in many important applications:

> Use Roaring for bitmap compression whenever possible. Do not use other bitmap compression methods ([Wang et al., SIGMOD 2017](http://db.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sidm338-wangA.pdf))


There is a serialized format specification for interoperability between implementations: https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringFormatSpec/

# Objective

The primary goal of the CRoaring is to provide a high performance low-level implementation that fully take advantage
of the latest hardware. Roaring bitmaps are already available on a variety of platform through Java, Go, Rust... implementations. CRoaring is a library that seeks to achieve superior performance by staying close to the latest hardware.


(c) 2016-2017 The CRoaring authors.



# Requirements

- The library should build on a  Linux-like operating system (including MacOS).
- We also support Microsoft Visual studio.
- Though most reasonable processors should be supported, we expect a recent Intel processor: Haswell (2013) or better but support all x64/x86 processors. The library builds without problem on ARM processors.
- Recent C compiler supporting the C11 standard (GCC 4.8 or better or clang), there is also an optional C++ class that requires a C++ compiler supporting the C++11 standard.
- CMake (to contribute to the project, users can rely on amalgamation/unity builds).
- clang-format (optional).

Serialization on big endian hardware may not be compatible with serialization on little endian hardware.

# Amalgamation/Unity Build

The CRoaring library can be amalgamated into a single source file that makes it easier
for integration into other projects. Moreover, by making it possible to compile
all the critical code into one compilation unit, it can improve the performance. For
the rationale, please see the SQLite documentation, https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html,
or the corresponding Wikipedia entry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Compilation_Unit).
Users who choose this route, do not need to rely on CRoaring's build system (based on CMake).

We maintain pre-generated amalgamated files at https://github.com/lemire/CRoaringUnityBuild for your convenience.

To generate the amalgamated files yourself, you can invoke a bash script...

```bash
./amalgamation.sh
```

(Bash shells are standard under Linux and macOS. Bash shells are available under Windows as part of the Â [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) under the name ``Git Shell``. So if you have cloned the ``CRoaring`` GitHub repository from within the GitHub Desktop, you can right-click on ``CRoaring``, select ``Git Shell`` and then enter the above commands.)

It is not necessary to invoke the script in the CRoaring directory. You can invoke
it from any directory where you want the amalgamation files to be written.

It will generate three files for C users: ``roaring.h``, ``roaring.c`` and ``amalgamation_demo.c``... as well as some brief instructions. The ``amalgamation_demo.c`` file is a short example, whereas ``roaring.h`` and ``roaring.c`` are "amalgamated" files (including all source and header files for the project). This means that you can simply copy the files ``roaring.h`` and ``roaring.c`` into your project and be ready to go! No need to produce a library! See the ``amalgamation_demo.c`` file.

For example, you can use the C code as follows:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "roaring.c"
int main() {
  roaring_bitmap_t *r1 = roaring_bitmap_create();
  for (uint32_t i = 100; i < 1000; i++) roaring_bitmap_add(r1, i);
  printf("cardinality = %d\n", (int) roaring_bitmap_get_cardinality(r1));
  roaring_bitmap_free(r1);
  return 0;
}
```

The script will also generate C++ files for C++ users, including an example. You can use the C++ as follows.

```
#include <iostream>
#include "roaring.hh"
#include "roaring.c"
int main() {
  Roaring r1;
  for (uint32_t i = 100; i < 1000; i++) {
    r1.add(i);
  }
  std::cout << "cardinality = " << r1.cardinality() << std::endl;

  Roaring64Map r2;
  for (uint64_t i = 18000000000000000100ull; i < 18000000000000001000ull; i++) {
    r2.add(i);
  }
  std::cout << "cardinality = " << r2.cardinality() << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

If you prefer a silent output, you can use the following command to redirect ``stdout`` :

```bash
./amalgamation.sh > /dev/null
```

# API

The interface is found in the file ``include/roaring/roaring.h``.

# Example (C)

```c

# Building with cmake (Linux and macOS, Visual Studio users should see below)

CRoaring follows the standard cmake workflow. Starting from the root directory of
the project (CRoaring), you can do:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
# follow by 'make test' if you want to test.
# you can also type 'make install' to install the library on your system
```
(You can replace the ``build`` directory with any other directory name.)

By default, on all platforms, we build a dynamic library. You can generate a static library by adding ``-DBUILD_STATIC=ON`` to the command line.

As with all ``cmake`` projects, you can specify the compilers you wish to use by adding (for example) ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++`` to the ``cmake`` command line.



If wish to build an x64 version while disabling AVX2 and BMI2 support at the expense of performance, you can do the following :

```
mkdir -p buildnoavx
cd buildnoavx
cmake -DDISABLE_AVX=ON ..
make
```

If you have x64 hardware, but you wish to disable all x64-specific optimizations (including AVX), then you can
do the following...

```
mkdir -p buildnox64
cd buildnoavx
cmake -DDISABLE_X64=ON ..
make
```


For a debug release, starting from the root directory of the project (CRoaring), try

```
mkdir -p debug
cd debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DSANITIZE=ON ..
make
```

(Again, you can use the ``-DDISABLE_AVX=ON`` flag if you need it.)

(Of course you can replace the ``debug`` directory with any other directory name.)


To run unit tests (you must first run ``make``):

```
make test
```

The detailed output of the tests can be found in ``Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log``.

To run real-data benchmark

```
./real_bitmaps_benchmark ../benchmarks/realdata/census1881
```
where you must adjust the path "../benchmarks/realdata/census1881" so that it points to one of the directories in the benchmarks/realdata directory.


To check that your code abides by the style convention (make sure that ``clang-format`` is installed):

```
./tools/clang-format-check.sh
```

To reformat your code according to the style convention (make sure that ``clang-format`` is installed):

```
./tools/clang-format.sh
```

# Building (Visual Studio under Windows)

We are assuming that you have a common Windows PC with at least Visual Studio 2015, and an x64 processor.

To build with at least Visual Studio 2015 from the command line:
- Grab the CRoaring code from GitHub, e.g., by cloning it using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). When you install it, make sure to ask that ``cmake`` be made available from the command line.
- Create a subdirectory within CRoaring, such as ``VisualStudio``.
- Using a shell, go to this newly created directory. For example, within GitHub Desktop, you can right-click on Â ``CRoaring`` in your GitHub repository list, and select ``Open in Git Shell``, then type ``cd VisualStudio`` in the newly created shell.
- Type ``cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 ..`` in the shell while in the ``VisualStudio`` repository. (Alternatively, if you want to build a static library, you may use the command line ``cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 -DBUILD_STATIC=ON  ..``.)
- This last command created a Visual Studio solution file in the newly created directory (e.g., ``RoaringBitmap.sln``). Open this file in Visual Studio. You should now be able to build the project and run the tests. For example, in the ``Solution Explorer`` window (available from the ``View`` menu), right-click ``ALL_BUILD`` and select ``Build``. To test the code, still in the ``Solution Explorer`` window, select ``RUN_TESTS`` and select ``Build``.

To build with at least Visual Studio 2017 directly in the IDE:
- Grab the CRoaring code from GitHub, e.g., by cloning it using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
- Select the ``Visual C++ tools for CMake`` optional component when installing the C++ Development Workload within Visual Studio.
- Within Visual Studio use ``File > Open > Folder...`` to open the CRoaring folder.
- Right click on CMakeLists.txt in the parent directory within ``Solution Explorer`` and select ``Build`` to build the project.
- For testing, in the Standard toolbar, drop the ``Select Startup Item...`` menu and choose one of the tests. Run the test by pressing the button to the left of the dropdown.

# Thread safety

Life, for example, STL containers or Java's default data structures, the CRoaring library has no built-in thread support. Thus whenever you modify a bitmap in one thread, it is unsafe to query it in others. It is safe however to query bitmaps (without modifying them) from several distinct threads,  as long as you do not use the copy-on-write attribute. For example, you can safely copy a bitmap and use both copies in concurrently. One should probably avoid the use of the copy-on-write attribute in a threaded environment.
